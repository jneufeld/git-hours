# git_hours

A CLI tool that prints a histogram of commits by hour for a git repository.

This useless program was (possibly?) my first Rust program. I was interested in when engineers were seemingly most productive, in some sense of the word. I seem to make my commits in the afternoon or late evening. Those that churn out code before 9 a.m. frighten me.
